                    <p>In this piece I practiced Photogrammetry and 3D scanning with an app on my iPhone XR called "Trnio". 
                        I used my coworker as a model to scan. The scan was not as detailed as Agisoft Metashape or Reality Capture .
                        and the model came out smooth and a little decimated. I decided to make him look polished like a metal statue. 
                        The background was a stretched image that gave a blur effect as if 
                        we took a photo focused on the subject giving him a realistic scene. wq

                    </p>
                    <br>
                        <p>For this piece I created a virtual reality in Maya. 
                            I wanted to explore textures and UV mapping images on polygonal
                            models. <i>Food for Thought</i> is a surreal environment of giant foods that 
                            feed my guilty pleasures. As I get older, I find myself thinking more about my choice of food; 
                            therefore, I created giant foods falling into a morphed hole with "The Thinker" looking as if
                            he is contemplating the bad decisions.

                    <br>
                    <p>This was my first-time creating art in a 3D environment. 
                        Minecraft is similar to low resolution pixelated images. 
                        The art reminds me of Sega Genesis or Gameboy games and how their characters 
                        used to look. I created a head of Grogu aka "Baby Yoda" as my first 
                        piece because at the time, The Mandalorian season two just came out.

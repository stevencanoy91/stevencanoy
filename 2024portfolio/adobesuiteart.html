                    <p>In p5js we can code many different ways. 
                        For this project I wanted to put together the 
                        things I enjoy the most which is summertime traveling, hiking, and 
                        listening to lo-fi music. Also, I have been fascinated with space and 
                        astronomy so I added what I think of as comets and shooting stars that blast off in random directions.
                        I wanted this piece to give the same positive energy I feel when I'm consumed by wanderlust.

                    <p>Using images as a tool to draw was the idea with this project. 
                        I used gif images as a tool because they gave more random patterns to the art. 
                        If you click and drag slowly, you will start to see the pattern of the image and where it leaves 
                        certain colors. I love the randomness of what you can create with all of the different keys. In my example, I 
                        created a background with The Flash and these dragon looking bodies with Super Mario, Sonic, and a Zombie.

                    <p>Exercise has been a routine in my life after I decided to make a change and get healthier.
                        In 2010, I began my fitness journey with a goal to lose one hundred pounds.
                        In 2012 I achieved my goal and have kept working out as part of my lifestyle. 
                        The same routine can be boring. That's why I love to hike and find new ways to exercise and 
                        make it fun so for this project, I created a workout randomizer that will give you different exercises to 
                        perform. Also, there is workout music coded into the project if you donâ€™t have any. So just enter the amount 
                        of reps you want to do and get sweaty!

                        <i>Champions Touch</i> 1079 x 808
                    </p>
                    <p>I created this piece by data bending the raw image file through Audacity.
                        The original image is of Tom Brady being helped to his car after a day 
                        of drinking at the Buccaneer's Championship Parade. I opened the original 
                        image in Photoshop and saved the RAW file. Then, I uploaded the RAW file 
                        to Audacity which is an application for music and sound. Next, I added
                        an echo effect to the RAW data and saved the new RAW file. Finally, I 
                        uploaded the new RAW file back to photoshop and saw how the image was
                        sort of echoed and the colors became inverted.

                        <i>RGB and Me</i> 1200 x 800
                    </p>
                    <p>Lightroom Classic and Photoshop is where I can glitch images directly by their RGB values 
                        and invert the color of the image. I can also choose how far I want to shift a specific value. 
                        I can make them display close together or far apart like in <i>RGB and Me</i>. It is a fully controlled glitch
                        method aside from the Audacity data bending method. I find it less time consuming and easier to achieve the look I wanted.
